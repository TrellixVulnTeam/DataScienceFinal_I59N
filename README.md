# Data Sciece Final Project

## Introduction
The purpose of the project was to create a model to help twitch streamers determine success. The model predicts follower growth given performance based metrics which streamers can use to determine how well they did by comparing to actual follower count in any given year.

## Selection of Data
The model training and testing were done in visual studeo code.

The dataset used consists of statistics about the top 1001 twitch streamers based on total watch time. Other statistics include stream time, peak viewers, average viewers, followers, followers gained, viewers gained, whether or not they were twitch partnered, if the stream was mature or not, and the language spoken.

Partnered and mature were converted into binary from yes/no in order to make it easier to work with.

We also used a pipeline to include features that were necessary for our model to return coherent data.
